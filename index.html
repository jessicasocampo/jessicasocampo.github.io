        <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
          <p>
            The project involved designing a <h>tablet application prototype</h> as part of 
            Maple Leaf Foods’ <h>"Path to Paperless"</h> initiative. This application served
            as a universal form prototype/design system for employees to use at the plants,
            replacing paper forms such as inspection forms.
            It was developed exclusively for Maple Leaf Foods employees, specifically for plant workers.
            The goal was to <h>reduce paper usage across Maple Leaf Foods</h> by providing a digital solution
            that streamlined form-based tasks in an accessible and efficient way.
        </p>
        <br>
          <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
          <p>
            Plant workers relied on paper-based forms, which were inefficient,
             environmentally unfriendly, and challenging to manage. Maple 
             Leaf Foods wanted to <h>digitize this process</h> to align with their 
             sustainability goals. Employees wearing gloves needed the application to be 
             functional despite limited tactile precision.
          Employees who were <h>less tech-savvy</h> needed a user-friendly interface.
          The forms needed to balance simplicity and visual appeal while maintaining functionality. 
          The paper-based process was resource-intensive, less environmentally sustainable,
           and prone to inefficiencies. Digitization offered a way to <h>enhance operational
            effectiveness</h> and align with Maple Leaf Foods’ sustainability goals.
        </p>

              workflows, and challenges with transitioning to digital forms.</p></li>
              
              <li><p><b><i class="fa-solid fa-star-of-life"></i> Ideation:</b> 
              Brainstormed solutions collaboratively using Figma to create low-fidelity wireframes,
               which evolved into high-fidelity prototypes. Canva was used to source icons to 
               enhance the visual design.</p></li>
              <br>
              <p>This is the original design which got scrapped due to a new criteria so have no logo or mlf colours.</p>

        <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
        
          <p>
            The project focused on developing a Cultural Adjustment and Language Learning App to support
             international students in <h>overcoming language barriers, cultural adjustment challenges, and feelings of isolation.</h>
            The app was designed for international undergraduate students as the primary target audience, 
            addressing their unique challenges.
            <br>
            <br>
            The goal was to create an <h>augmented reality app</h> that helps international students
             improve language skills, understand cultural nuances, and practice real-life scenarios. 
             The app aimed to alleviate anxiety and mental health challenges, fostering better academic 
             and social integration.
        </p>
        <br>
          <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
          <p>
            International students often struggle with language barriers, adapting to cultural norms
             and feelings of isolation, which intensify <h>stress and mental health challenges.</h> These 
             difficulties make it harder for students to practice academic and conversational language,
            navigate cultural etiquette, and <h>feel supported in their new environments.</h> As a result,
            their academic performance, well-being, and ability to integrate into their communities
            suffer, highlighting a critical need for tailored mental health support and adjustment
            tools to address these unique challenges.

        <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
          <p>
            The project was about designing a mobile application aimed at raising awareness
             and <h>reducing the stigma around mental health</h> for pre-teens. It featured
              educational and engaging components to help foster a better understanding
              of mental health in a fun, interactive way. The application was developed
              for the <h>Sun Life UXperience Designathon.</h> The goal was to create an engaging
              and educational tool to help pre-teens understand mental health better,
             raise awareness, and combat the stigma surrounding it.
        </p>
        <br>
          <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
          <p>
            The key problem was the <h>lack of accessible, engaging resources aimed at
             reducing the stigma</h> around mental health for pre-teens. Mental health
              awareness is often overlooked at a younger age, especially for those
              in the pre-teen demographic. The primary challenge was that pre-teens
               often don’t have access to or understanding of mental health resources
                that are both appropriate and engaging for their age. This could lead
                 to misunderstandings or stigma around mental health. For Sun Life
                  and the UXperience Designathon, addressing mental health stigma
                   in the younger demographic could help in shaping a <h>more informed,
                    compassionate generation</h> and strengthen the community's
                     well-being and engagement.</p>

               with judges praising the engaging and educational design.
                Although there were no measurable metrics due to the
                 6-hour time limit, the judges <h>appreciated the balance
                  of usability, aesthetics, and educational value.</h>
                   They also provided constructive feedback, which
                    helped refine our concept. As our first designathon,
                     there was room for improvement, and we took the

        <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
          <p> The project involved redesigning the menu for Sushi Kui,
             a restaurant in Aurora. The focus was to create a more
              <h>user-centric and competitive menu</h> design by incorporating
               user research, competitor analysis, and principles of
                accessibility and usability. The goal was to improve
                 the <h>menu's usability and overall customer satisfaction</h>
                  through a redesign that reflected both the restaurant's
                   brand identity and its business objectives. 
                   Additionally, the redesign was necessary due to changes
                    in item prices, which needed to be integrated seamlessly
                     into the new layout.
        </p>
        <br>
          <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
          <p>
            The existing menu at Sushi Kui was not user-friendly,
             <h>lacked a modern and accessible layout, and required
              the incorporation of updated prices</h> for many items.
               Users struggled with navigating the old menu,
                which had poor visual hierarchy and lacked clarity,
                 making it difficult for them to make quick decisions.
                  This hindered overall dining satisfaction,
                   especially considering the diverse clientele of
                    young adults, middle-aged customers, and elders,
                     who had varying levels of technological familiarity.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                      For the business, these issues led to suboptimal
                       customer experiences, potentially reducing retention
                        and satisfaction. Furthermore, the outdated design
                         and pricing inconsistencies affected the restaurant’s
                          competitiveness and could create confusion among customers.

              <li><p><b><i class="fa-solid fa-star-of-life"></i> Research:</b> 
                I conducted user research to identify pain points in the current
                 menu and analyzed competitors' menus to understand industry
                  standards. This helped inform strategic design decisions,
                   ensuring the redesign would meet user needs and stand out
                    in the competitive market. I also took into account the
                     restaurant’s demographic of young adults, middle-aged
                      customers, and elders to <h>ensure the design was accessible
                       and easy to navigate for a wide age range.</h></p></li>
              
              <li><p><b><i class="fa-solid fa-star-of-life"></i> Ideation:</b>

                 ensuring the design aligned with both the brand's identity
                  and their vision. They gave me a lot of creative freedom,
                   but I made sure to incorporate their feedback throughout

                      high-quality, appetizing images that aligned
                       with the restaurant’s branding.</p></li>
              
              <li><p><b><i class="fa-solid fa-star-of-life"></i> Testing:</b> 
                I conducted informal testing with a few regular
                 customers to gather feedback on the new design,
                  focusing on usability and ease of navigation.
                   I iterated based on this feedback to refine
                    the design before finalizing it.</p></li>

          <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i> SOLUTION</h3>
          <p>The key features of the redesign included a streamlined
             layout with <h>clearly defined sections,</h> improved visual
              hierarchy, and <h>high-quality food photography</h> that
               aligned with the restaurant's brand identity.
                The design focused on enhancing the user experience
                 by making the menu easier to read and navigate,
                  with particular attention to accessibility for
                   all age groups. The integration of updated
                    prices was done in a clear, non-disruptive way.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                     This redesign significantly improved usability,
                      making the menu easier to understand and navigate,
                       which <h>enhanced the overall dining experience.</h> 
                       The updated prices and consistent branding ensured
                        the menu felt cohesive and professional, while
                         the focus on accessibility made it suitable for
                          a wide range of customers.
        </p>
          <br>
          <h3>IMPACT</h3>
            <p>The redesigned menu led to an increase in customer
               satisfaction, as the new layout was <h>more intuitive
                and visually appealing.</h> The updated pricing reduced
                 confusion, while the improved design made the menu
                  easier to navigate. Business owners also reported
                   increased sales and stronger customer loyalty.
                    Additionally, the redesign opened up opportunities
                     to create a <h>digital version of the menu accessible
                      via QR code,</h> offering a contactless, convenient
                       option for customers and positioning the 
                       restaurant for future growth.</p>

        <h3>WHAT DID I LEARN?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><p>
                I learned the importance of maintaining a balance between user-centric
                 design and business objectives. <h>Collaboration with the business owners
                 </h> was key to ensuring the design
                  met their vision while addressing user needs. 
              </p></li>
              <li><p>Additionally, I learned that updating pricing and making it easy to
                integrate into the design is crucial for a smooth customer experience,
                 especially when considering a broad age range of customers.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
          <b><i class="fa-solid fa-star-of-life"></i> Challenges I faced and how I overcame them.</b>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li><p>The main challenge was taking high-quality photos of the food,
               which took considerable time and effort. 
               I overcame this by planning a dedicated photo session,
                ensuring the images were both visually appealing and aligned with the brand. 
                </p></li>
                <li><p>Additionally, ensuring that the pricing changes were incorporated
                  seamlessly into the design required <h>constant communication</h>
                   with the owners.</p></li>
          </ul>

          <b><i class="fa-solid fa-star-of-life"></i> Skills Gained:</b>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li><p>I gained skills in user research, UX/UI design,
               and collaboration with clients to ensure the final
                product met brand objectives. I learned to integrate
                 pricing updates while maintaining usability and
                  clarity. Additionally, I developed insight into
                   age-inclusive design, making the menu accessible
                    to a diverse customer base.</p></li>
