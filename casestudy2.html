                    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                    <p>A user-friendly finance tracker application is the topic we have decided to explore for our
                         group project. The major goal of this software is to reduce stress for individuals who have
                          trouble managing finances due to their busy lifestyle, poor organization skills etc. This
                           topic will focus on university students as they are the primary demographic being impacted
                            by poor finance management. This application will help students with a common problem of
                             overspending and not paying bills on time; rent, tuition, or credit card bills by providing
                              daily alarms, financial objectives, advice, and other features like tracking transactions.
                               For example, an individual is complaining to his bank since they did not inform him 
                               earlier that he was reaching the limit on his credit card and is now getting charged 
                               extra money. Addressing this problem and its solution is crucial because it will assist 
                               university students in living healthier lifestyles and help them become successful in the
                                future, which is good for the economy as a whole.

                <p>User task Description 1: Tracking Spending Habits</p>
                <img src="persona1.png" style="width: 600px;">
            
                    <p>Jane is a hardworking student who wants to be more 
                        responsible for her spending habits and create a monthly
                         spending goal to make sure she stays within her budget. 
                         She knows by setting these goals will allow her to consider
                          her long-term financial goals like paying tuition. 
                          To start, Jane determines all the ways she uses her money,
                           which includes personal spendings (like shopping), eating
                            out with friends, and education-related costs (tuition bills
                             and textbooks). She decides on how much she wants to spend
                              each month and splits the amount among these categories. 
                              She goes into the app and sets a $175 limit for the month.
                               Jane decides to allocate $50 for personal spendings, 
                               $50 for eating out, and set aside $75 for educational 
                               expenses. Now, whenever she purphases something, the app 
                               is aware of what the money was used for. It records and 
                               categorizes her expenses while also being able to see her 
                               progress towards her monthly spending goals.

                    <p>Discussion:</p>
                    <p>To improve spending habits and be financially disciplined, 
                        this user task is a crucial task to manage expenses. 
                        Setting monthly spending goals can help users be reminded
                         about how their money is being spent so they can reach their
                         \ financial goals. Users can perform this task monthly or 
                         anytime they feel like adjusting their spending limits in 
                         certain circumstances. By creating these goals, users can 
                         analyze what most of their money is used for, cut down on their 
                         impulsive spendings, and efficiently use the resources they 
                         have to achieve their goals. By learning to budget effectively,
                         users will be one step closer to making smart money choices for 
                         a successful future.

                        <p>Steven is a busy university student who is willing to put in
                         the work to build his budgeting and emergency funds to save
                          more money. He wants to make sure he has money set aside for
                           adulthood and any emergencies that may occur. Although he 
                           is always occupied he wants to set time aside to create tips
                            and split the budget of his necessities in order to use his 
                            money wisely. This student wants to spend 50% on needs which
                             includes school, transportation and food, 10% on wants which
                              includes entertainment and 40% on savings. He is willing to
                               put almost half his income towards savings as he plans to
                                begin a small business later on. Steven puts his custom 
                                budgeting expenses into the app to plan ahead. As he spends
                                 the circle chart with his budget will slowly fill up each 
                                 section with a corresponding colour. In a separate section 
                                 of the app, this individual adds saving tips using a listing 
                                 feature to remember to apply them when spending. </p>

                        <p>This user's task is to budget and save expenses 
                            to live comfortably in the meantime and begin 
                            a small business later on. By setting limits by 
                            percentage to how much he can spend, it easily 
                            influences how his money can be used. The chart 
                            reminds users how much of each category has already
                             been spent during the course of a week. The use of 
                             eminders on tips reminds Steven so he does not forget 
                             how to save and settles for products that may seem 
                             more convenient but waste more money. By using this app,
                              it makes Stevenâ€™s saving journey more efficient for his 
                              busy lifestyle.

                            <p>Description: In our first prototype, we present a 
                                storyboard that illustrates a crucial user task 
                                within the app. This storyboard guides you through
                                 a concise, step-by-step interaction where a user 
                                 expresses their desire to purchase a new laptop and
                                  utilizes the app to initiate a new financial goal. 
                                  Through this goal-setting process, the user gains 
                                  the ability to allocate specific portions of their 
                                  budget to this goal, aligning with their existing 
                                  financial goals. This version was improved through 
                                  adding more detail for where the user goes from the
                                   homepage to get to the desired page, as well as 
                                   showing what type of information is required for 
                                   adding a new goal.</p>

                                            this set of screens. These screens include 
                                            some of the key pages that the app may have, 
                                            including secured registration, view of home page,
                                             goals setting, account balance, profile, and settings
                                              page. How this version improved or encapsulated 
                                              previous ideas is by deciding which task would 
                                              be the most important to users. We've captured
                                               a more comprehensive depiction of the app by 
                                               offering a range of screens, meeting the needs
                                                of different user bases. Through offering a
